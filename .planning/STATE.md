# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-20)

**Core value:** The CPU rasterizer must produce visually identical output to the C++ engine -- same glyphs, same colors, same depth ordering -- so that existing Asciicker worlds render correctly in the Rust port.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- D001: Use Bevy 0.18 engine (ECS, input, audio, windowing)
- D003: CPU rasterizer first, GPU only for final ASCII output
- D010: Keep auto_mat initially, upgrade to Alex Harri 6D shape vectors later

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Existing skeleton has structural problems (wrong crate type, wrong audio version, no plugin architecture) -- Phase 1 must decide salvage vs restructure vs restart
- bevy_kira_audio must be 0.25 (not 0.24) for Bevy 0.18 compatibility
- lightyear 0.24.x Bevy 0.18 compatibility unverified (Phase 7 concern, not blocking now)
